# Rice-Grain-Classification
During my graduate studies, I completed a project titled "Classification and Evaluation of Rice Grain Quality Employing Deep Learning" using the ResNet-50 architecture.

In this project, I aimed to develop an accurate and efficient model for classifying and evaluating the quality of rice grains based on various characteristics. I utilized the ResNet-50 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network renowned for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

The project involved collecting a diverse dataset comprising images of rice grains with different quality attributes such as size, shape, color, and texture. Preprocessing techniques such as image augmentation, normalization, and resizing were applied to enhance the robustness and generalization of the model.

Throughout the development process, I employed deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing their extensive libraries and tools for model training, evaluation, and optimization. I also fine-tuned the hyperparameters to maximize the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.

To evaluate the model's performance, I employed evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy. Through rigorous testing and validation, the model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying rice grains into different quality categories, providing valuable insights into the grain's overall quality and potential applications.

This project not only deepened my understanding of deep learning methodologies and computer vision but also equipped me with practical experience in working with complex architectures like ResNet-50. It showcased my ability to leverage state-of-the-art technologies and apply them to real-world problems in the agricultural domain.
